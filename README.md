# What is Node.js?

> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

# TLDR

```bash
docker run -it --name node bitnami/node
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
node:
  image: bitnami/node
  command: npm start
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Node.js Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/node).

```bash
docker pull bitnami/node:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/node/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
docker pull bitnami/node:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t bitnami/node https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-node.git
```

# Entering the REPL

By default, running this image will drop you into the Node.js REPL, where you can interactively test and try things out in Node.js.

```bash
docker run -it --name node bitnami/node
```

  - [nodejs.org/api/repl.html](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html)

# Running your Node.js script

The default work directory for the Node.js image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Node.js script, and run it normally using the `node` command.

```bash
docker run -it --name node -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/node \
  node script.js
```

# Running a Node.js app with npm dependencies

If your Node.js app has a `package.json` defining your app's dependencies and start script, you can install the dependencies before running your app.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/node npm install
docker run -it --name node  -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/node npm start
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
node:
  image: bitnami/node
  command: "sh -c 'npm install && npm start'"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

- [npm start script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#default-values)

# Accessing a Node.js app running a web server

By default the image exposes the port `3000` of the container. You can use this port for your Node.js application server.

Below is an example of an [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) app listening to remote connections on port `3000`:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

var server = app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', function () {

  var host = server.address().address;
  var port = server.address().port;

  console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port);
});
```

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to port `3000` inside the container.

```bash
docker run -it --name node -v /path/to/app:/app -P bitnami/node node index.js
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random port Docker assigned.

```bash
$ docker port node
3000/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769
```

You can also specify the port you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```bash
docker run -it --name node -p 8080:3000 -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/node node index.js
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

# Linking

If you want to connect to your Node.js web server inside another container, you can use the linking system provided by Docker.

## Serving your Node.js app through an nginx frontend

We may want to make our Node.js web server only accessible via an nginx web server. Doing so will allow us to setup more complex configuration, serve static assets using nginx, load balance to different Node.js instances, etc.

### Step 1: Create a virtual host

Let's create an nginx virtual host to reverse proxy to our Node.js container.

```nginx
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:80;
    server_name yourapp.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        # proxy_pass http://[your_node_container_link_alias]:3000;
        proxy_pass http://yourapp:3000;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

Notice we've substituted the link alias name `yourapp`, we will use the same name when creating the link.

Copy the virtual host above, saving the file somewhere on your host. We will mount it as a volume in our nginx container.

### Step 2: Run the Node.js image with a specific name

Docker's linking system uses container ids or names to reference containers. We can explicitly specify a name for our Node.js server to make it easier to connect to other containers.

```bash
docker run -it --name node -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/node node index.js
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
node:
  image: bitnami/node
  command: node index.js
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

### Step 3: Run the nginx image and link it to the Node.js server

Now that we have our Node.js server running, we can create another container that links to it by giving Docker the `--link` option. This option takes the id or name of the container we want to link it to as well as a hostname to use inside the container, separated by a colon. For example, to have our Node.js server accessible in another container with `yourapp` as it's hostname we would pass `--link node:yourapp` to the Docker run command.

```bash
docker run -it -v /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf:ro \
  --link node:yourapp \
  bitnami/nginx
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
nginx:
  image: bitnami/nginx
  links:
    - node:yourapp
  volumes:
    - /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf:ro
```

We started the nginx server, mounting the virtual host we created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-virtual-host), and created a link to the Node.js server with the alias `yourapp`.

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Node.js, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
docker pull bitnami/node:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/node:latest`.

### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```bash
docker rm -v node
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose rm -v node
```

### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
docker run --name node bitnami/node:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose start node
```

# Testing

This image is tested for expected runtime behavior, using the [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) testing framework. You can run the tests on your machine using the `bats` command.

```bash
bats test.sh
```

# Notable Changes

## 5.10.1-0 (2016-04-21)

- The `USER bitnami` instruction is removed from the `Dockerfile`. Commands are now executed as the `root` user by default.

## 4.1.2-0 (2015-10-12)

- Permissions fixed so `bitnami` user can install global npm modules without needing `sudo`.

## 4.1.1-0-r01 (2015-10-07)

- `/app` directory is no longer exported as a volume. This caused problems when building on top of the image, since changes in the volume are not persisted between Dockerfile `RUN` instructions. To keep the previous behavior (so that you can mount the volume in another container), create the container with the `-v /app` option.
